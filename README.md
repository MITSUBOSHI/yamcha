# Yamcha

Yamcha is a Yaml Validator.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'yamcha'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install yamcha

## Usage

```ruby
yaml = {a: 1}.to_yaml
Yamcha::Validator.new(yaml).validate!
#=> {":a"=>"1"}
```

If there is a duplicated mapping key in the yaml, it occures raise `Yamcha::Validator::DuplicatedMappingKey::Error`.

```ruby
yaml = <<~YAML
---
a: 1
a: 2
YAML
Yamcha::Validator.new(yaml).validate!
#=> Yamcha::Validator::DuplicatedMappingKey::Error (duplicated key `a` exists)
```

If you would like to validate `*.yml` file itself, please try like the following example.

```ruby
Yamcha::Validator.new(File.read('./sample.yml')).validate!
```
